To estimate $\\hat{F}_n$ use a histogram (`np.histogram`). Repeat this $K=1000$ times and compute the percentage of time that the interval contained the CDF (print the value) . In addition, plot in another single figure the *true* CDF, and the best and worst experiments (use $\\max_x|F(x) - \\hat{F}_n(x)|$ as quality measure).\n",

The control group consists of 64 healthy individuals (23 men and 41 women) with ages varying between 41 and 82. During the data collection process, the microphone is set to 44.1 KHz and following the examination, the sustained phonation of the vowel /a/ was collected from each subject with three repetitions. \n",
